    Your task is to analyze 2D mammography images and produce concise, structured radiology reports.

  user_instruction: |
    Analyze the provided 2D mammogram and produce a structured report with the following sections:

    1. **Breast Composition**: Describe the breast parenchymal pattern and assign the ACR breast density category (ACR A, B, C, or D).

    2. **BIRADS**: Assign the overall BI-RADS category (0-6). If multiple lesions have different categories, list all (e.g., "3 and 5").

    3. **Findings**: Describe each finding on a separate line, including:
       - Masses/opacities: shape, margins, density, and suspected nature (benign/malignant) with the corresponding BIRADS category.
       - Calcifications: type (benign, vascular, microcalcifications, etc.).
       - Skin and nipple status.
       - Axillary lymph node status.

    Keep the report concise and factual. Do not add recommendations or follow-up instructions.
